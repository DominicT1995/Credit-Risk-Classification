# Credit-Risk-Classification
UTSA Data Analytics Bootcamp Supervised Machine Learning challenge using a dataset of historical lending activity to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

credit_risk_classification.ipynb

Within the Credit-Risk-Classification repository there is a jupyter notebook file called credit_risk_classification.ipynb which contains the python code that uses pandas and sklearn to import the lending_data.csv from the Resoruces folder and transform it intoa a DataFrame which is used to identify X and y labels. The code then takes these labels and uses them to train and test a supervised machine learning logistic regression model. The results of the model are then evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Detailed analysis of the supervised machine learning model is present within the credit_risk_classification_report markdown file.
